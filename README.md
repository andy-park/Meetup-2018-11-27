# Mobile for .NET developers
### Nov. 27, 2018 - Dylan Berry

### Abstract
Mobile experiences account for the majority of digital interaction for consumers and business users. There is much to consider when building a single experience and it is essential to determine the broader experience. We will discuss how to build a mobile strategy, the challenges of developing for mobile; from design to launch to feedback and the tools available to help you be successful. Developers familiar with .NET and other Microsoft technologies have a distinctive edge due to Xamarin, App Center and Azure. We will explore these tools and compare them to other tools available in the marketplace.
